                    <h2>What are periods ?</h2>
                    <p>Your child will go through many changes in puberty. One of the most significant milestones is
                        your child's first period.<br>
                        Periods are part of the menstrual cycle. They happen because of changing hormone levels in the
                        ovaries, which affect the uterus.
                        Here’s what happens in a menstrual cycle:<br>
                        <br>
                        The hormone Oestrogen is produced in the ovaries in cysts or sacs called follicles. The
                        oestrogen stimulates the follicles to produce eggs. Usually only one egg matures and is
                        released. When the egg is released, the ovary produces a second hormone, called progesterone.
                        The egg moves from the ovary to the fallopian tube and travels towards the uterus.
                        In response to the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, the uterus makes a lining to prepare for
                        the arrival and implantation of a fertilised egg.
                        If the egg isn’t fertilised, hormone levels fall. This leads to the lining of the uterus being
                        shed through the vagina. The lining is blood and other tissue.<br>
                        <br>
                        This last step is what we call a ‘period’. Most of the blood and tissue comes out in the first
                        couple of days, but some people have bleeding for up to seven days. The amount of bleeding
                        varies.

                    <h2>When do periods start?</h2>
                    <p>Most young people will have their first periods when they’re between 11 and 14½, but anywhere
                        from 9-16 years is considered normal.
                        <br>
                        Periods are likely to start soon if your child has:
                        <br>
                        had a major growth spurt
                        grown some underarm and pubic hair
                        developed breasts.
                        <br>
                        If your child hasn’t started their period by the time they turn 16, it’s a good idea to talk
                        with your child’s GP. There can be many reasons why periods haven’t started by then, and the GP
                        can help to rule out any serious problems.

                    <h2>Period cycle</h2>

                    <p>The time from the first day of one period to the first day of the next is sometimes called a
                        ‘cycle’. Cycles are usually between 25 and 35 days. But periods might not be regular for the
                        first few years, so cycles might change from one period to the next.
                        <br>
                        Irregular cycles can be as short as 21 days, and as long as 45 days (or even longer). Young
                        people who start their periods earlier will usually get a regular cycle more quickly than those
                        who start their periods later.

                    <h2>Practical preparation</h2>
                    <p>Your child will need a supply of sanitary pads, period-proof underpants, tampons and/or a
                        menstrual cup.

                        Before your child gets their first period, it’s a good idea to show your child:<br>

                        what pads, period-proof underpants, tampons and cups look like
                        how to use pads, period-proof underpants, tampons and cups
                        how to dispose of pads and tampons, or rinse period-proof underpants
                        how to clean a menstrual cup.
                        <b>You might want to suggest your child carries pads, underpants, tampons or a cup. For example,
                            they could keep some in a small bag in their school bag and sports bag.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Pads, underpants, tampons or a menstrual cup?</b>
                        <br>
                        It’s probably easier for your child to start with pads or period-proof underpants before they
                        try tampons or a menstrual cup.
                        <br>
                        Your child can use tampons and cups at any age, but it can take some time and practice to get
                        used to them.
                        <br>
                        When your child is first starting with tampons or a menstrual cup, it might help to practise
                        between periods, to get used to inserting and removing them. For tampons it can help to put a
                        bit of lubricant or petroleum jelly on the tip of a tampon so it slides in more easily, or use
                        water as a lubricant for a menstrual cup. Looking at diagrams of the slope and shape of the
                        vagina can also help, as can using a mirror while practising.

                        Being comfortable with using tampons or a menstrual cup can be a big help in these busy and
                        active years.
                        <br>
                        <b>How many pads, tampons, period-proof underpants or cups?</b>
                        <br>
                        Your child will probably need to use 3-6 sanitary pads or tampons a day, although it might be
                        fewer on lighter days. In the first couple of days and at night, longer, thicker pads or pads
                        with wings can be good.

                        Your child will need to change their pad or tampon every 4-8 hours, depending on how heavy or
                        light the bleeding is.

                        Your child will need to use 1-2 pairs of period-proof underpants each day, depending on how
                        heavy their bleeding is and how absorbent the pants are. Period-proof underpants need to be
                        washed and dried between uses, so your child might need several pairs to get through their
                        period.

                        Your child will need 1-2 menstrual cups. Cups can be worn for up to 12 hours but might need to
                        be emptied and washed more often, depending on how heavy bleeding is. They need rinsing out
                        between uses.

                    <p>It’s good for your child to keep track of their periods with an app, calendar or diary. If your
                        child’s periods are fairly regular, an app or calendar can help your child know when their
                        period is likely to come. This way your child can prepare for things like sleepovers, school
                        camps or swimming carnivals.</p>
