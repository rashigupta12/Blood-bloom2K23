Period care for modern women , designed by women 


Blood Bloom website addresses the lack of comprehensive and accessible information, resources, and support for various aspects of women's health and hygiene. The problem statement includes the need for quality check of sanitary pads, an effective period tracker, reliable information about different types of medicines, menopause management, addressing the concerns of boys in supporting women's health, and creating awareness about women's hygiene through online webinars. These gaps result in potential health risks, misinformation, confusion, stigma, and poor hygiene practices. By providing reliable information, resources, and support, Blood Bloom aims to empower women, girls, and boys with knowledge, promote healthy relationships, self-care, and awareness, and improve the overall well-being of women.
